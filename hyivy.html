              Hyivy health is a femtech startup aiming to create a rehabilitation device with trackable data for women who have pelvic cancers and diseases. The goal of the device is to help alleviate pelvic health symptoms in women after a devastating diagnosis, treatment or surgery.

            1 in 3 women will have pelvic health problems in their lifetime. 
            After a devastating diagnosis, treatment or surgery, the recovery process for women is extremely difficult, painful, confusing, and not streamlined.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p class="pt-3">To better understand our users, their stories battling cancer, and their current experiences with therapies. The team and I conducted user interviews with 5 pelvic cancer patients from across the world: Canada, US, Japan, and France. To ensure we captured an accurate and complete picture of womanhood and women's experiences, we interviewed both cisgender and transgender women. </p>

          <h3>Insights & Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="pt-3">
              <li>The post surgery therapy for pelvic disease patients is very underdeveloped and inconsistent across different nations. </li>
              <li>There is, in fact, almost no research done or being done to try to improve the rehabilitation experience of pelvic disease patients.</li>
              <li>Depending on the doctor, the treatment experience differs greatly from patient to patient.</li>
              <li>The post pelvic surgery therapy includes: dilation, heat therapy, cold therapy, and medicine application to the cervix. </li>
              <li>When going through the therapies, patients often feel anxious and scared as they do not have any knowledge of what to expect.</li>
              <li>A lot of patients going through the post surgical treatments give up and abandon the therapy process because they feel like it is not working or it is too painful.</li>

          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          <p class="pt-3">Women need a safe, trustworthy, informative and comforting set of products during a time they are most fearful and vulnerable. Hyivy’s solution to providing women with a more streamlined and comfortable recovery experience is through a multifunctional therapy device as well as a mobile app. Together, the connected smart device provides real time information to give women the most comfortable and informed experience through their pelvic health recovery.

          <h3>The Branding</h3>
          <img class="pt-5 pb-5" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="imgs/branding.png" alt="">
          <p class="pt-5">In colour theory, green is a colour that represents health, whereas blue represents trustworthiness. Teal is the result of mixing green and blue, which is the main colour I decided to go with.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The logo is an ivy leaf with two ivy vines extending from its base, which echoes the company’s name “Hyivy”.
            The upside down shape of the ivy leaf is symbolic of the uterus, and the ivy vines represent fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus as the logo reinforces the mission statement of Hyivy and upholds our feminist values. At Hyivy, we want to create the most comfortable experience for patients with pelvic health issues. Part of that involves destigmatizing talking about women's reproductive organs. Displaying a uterus as the logo is a bold statement in a society that considers women's body parts as taboo and hypersexualized.</p>

          <p>The curved shaft and tip design allows the patient to reach the cervix easily so medication and lubrication can be directly delivered and applied.

During therapy sessions, the app will receive data from the device and represent it in a user-friendly way. The app can also be used to track process, review previous session records as well as serve educational purposes to those new to the therapy. </p>

          <p class="pt-5">One of the core functions of this app is to display live data collected from the device to the user’s phones during therapy sessions. Thus, there must be an easy-to-access way to connect the user’s device to their phone. The My Device tab not only makes the process of connecting to a device easy and intuitive, once connected, it will also display information about the specific model connected, and alert the user if refills or recharge is needed. </p>

          <p class="pt-5">This is where all the core functions of the app are delivered. The “Sessions & Records” section of the app keeps track of the user’s scheduled therapy sessions and alerts them if one is coming up. 
            During a therapy session, it keeps track of a timer and displays live data transmitted from the device, such as temperature, proximity, pressure, and humidity. 
            It also keeps a record of the past therapy sessions, which the user can look back on to see the improvements they have made or adjust the therapy to better fit their recovery.

          <p class="pt-5">This section is made to target the patients who are feeling confused and are seeking support, which is the case for most people going through treatment. 
            The Blog section is a platform where the user will find tutorials, as well as forums and blogs of other patients going through similar therapies. 
            Through our user interviews, we found that talking to people with similar experiences is a crucial way to reduce anxiety and depression among pelvic disease patients. 
            The Blog allows them to connect to each other and become educated on their disease and treatments.

          <h4>Feature Breakdown: Gamification</h4>
          <p class="pt-5">As we learned from our user interviews, some patients abandon treatment midway because they do not see any progress or they are simply depressed.
            The concept behind an incentive-based system was my idea I brought to the Hyivy team. I designed a simple and cute game that gives rewards both as in-game collectives and as real-life coupons in order to encourage patients to continue their treatment. The game’s aesthetics are very simplistic and cute, which appeals to the target group of users.

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p class="pt-5">Almost all of the decisions made during the designing of this product and app were based on the information we collected from our user interviews during the research stage. That being said, there are likely pain points and perspectives that we may have missed in our current design. Testing our assumptions and verifying the user experience decisions we've made will be a positive next step. 
            To test the physical product, life ratio product models will be 3D printed and sent out to volunteers for testing. Based on the results, the shape and feel of the product are subjected to change. 
            Another next step would be to identify key metrics post-launch, to measure usability and success. This can help us validate or challenge some of the assumptions made during the process.
