              Hyivy health is a femtech startup aiming to create a rehabilitation device with trackable data for women who have pelvic cancers and diseases. The goal of the device is to help alleviate pelvic health symptoms in women after a devastating diagnosis, treatment or surgery.

            1 in 3 women will have pelvic health problems in their lifetime. 
            After a devastating diagnosis, treatment or surgery, the recovery process for women is extremely difficult, painful, confusing, and not streamlined.

          <p class="pt-3">To better understand our users, their stories battling cancer, and their current experiences with therapies. The team and I conducted user interviews with 5 pelvic cancer patients from across the world: Canada, US, Japan, and France. To ensure we captured an accurate and complete picture of womanhood and women's experiences, we interviewed both cisgender and transgender women. </p>

            <ul class="pt-3">
              <li>The post surgery therapy for pelvic disease patients is very underdeveloped and inconsistent across different nations. </li>
              <li>There is, in fact, almost no research done or being done to try to improve the rehabilitation experience of pelvic disease patients.</li>
              <li>Depending on the doctor, the treatment experience differs greatly from patient to patient.</li>
              <li>The post pelvic surgery therapy includes: dilation, heat therapy, cold therapy, and medicine application to the cervix. </li>
              <li>When going through the therapies, patients often feel anxious and scared as they do not have any knowledge of what to expect.</li>
              <li>A lot of patients going through the post surgical treatments give up and abandon the therapy process because they feel like it is not working or it is too painful.</li>

          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          <p class="pt-3 pb-4">Women need a safe, trustworthy, informative and comforting set of products during a time they are most fearful and vulnerable. Hyivy’s solution to providing women with a more streamlined and comfortable recovery experience is through a <b>multifunctional therapy device</b> as well as a <b>mobile app</b>. Together, the connected smart device provides real time information to give women the most comfortable and informed experience through their pelvic health recovery.

          <h3>The Branding</h3>
          <img class="pt-5" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="imgs/branding-iteration.png" alt="">
          <p class="">I experimented with many different elements and colours for the branding of Hyivy as my boss simply suggested me to go wild. However, I did make up my own themes to follow in order to create a consistent yet vibrant brand image. 
            I focused on including some plant elements to echo the "ivy" in the logo while trying to reflect a free, positive and trustworthy energy. After iterations and a final voting, the design below was determined to represent Hyivy.</p>
          <img class="pt-5 pb-5" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;" src="imgs/branding.png" alt="">
          <p class="pt-5">In colour theory, green is a colour that represents health, whereas blue represents trustworthiness. Teal is the result of mixing green and blue, which is the main colour I decided to go with.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The logo is an ivy leaf with two ivy vines extending from its base, which echoes the company’s name “Hyivy”.
            The upside down shape of the ivy leaf is symbolic of the uterus, and the ivy vines represent fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus as the logo reinforces the mission statement of Hyivy and upholds our feminist values. At Hyivy, we want to create the most comfortable experience for patients with pelvic health issues. Part of that involves destigmatizing talking about women's reproductive organs. Displaying a uterus as the logo is a bold statement in a society that considers women's body parts as taboo and hypersexualized.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h2>The App</h2>
          <p class="pt-5">This app was intended to be used with the medical device Hyivy is planning to release. During therapy sessions, the app will receive data from the device and represent it in a user-friendly way. The app can also be used to track process, review previous session records as well as serve educational purposes to those new to the therapy. </p>
        
          <h4 class="pt-5">User Flow Diagram</h4>
          <p class="pt-3 pb-5">In order to create the initial design of the application, I created a user flow diagram to shape out the information architecture that will ultimately determine the structure of the app.</p>

            <img class="pb-5" style="width: 100%;" src="imgs/preliminary.png" alt="">
          </button>

          <h4 class="pt-5">Wireframing</h4>
          <p class="pt-5 pb-3">After getting the user flow diagram approved with the team, I started the wireframing process. I experimented on a variety of different structural frameworks and layouts to capture the overall visual approach of the app. All final decisions of the wireframes were made to minimize complexity and reduce possible confusion as the majority of our target users are of older age.</p>

            During a therapy session, it keeps track of a timer and displays live data transmitted from the device, such as temperature, proximity, pressure, and humidity. 
            It also keeps a record of the past therapy sessions, which the user can look back on to see the improvements they have made or adjust the therapy to better fit their recovery.

            <h3 class="pt-5">Ideation</h3>
            <p class="pt-3">To generate a design and a 3D prototype for the Hyivy device, I studied the very early-stage minimal design that were put together by the engineeirng team as well as conducted extensive market research on the competitor products. I then sketched out the ideas I had for the appearance of the product.</p>

              The 2 metal rings on the shaft of the device can heat up and cool down to perform heat and cold therapy, which both have significant impact on relieving pain and discomfort. This function gets rid of the need to heat up a dilator with warm or cold water, which can be inconvinient and time cosuming. </p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p class="py-5">Almost all of the decisions made during the designing of this product and app were based on the information we collected from our user interviews during the research stage. That being said, there are likely pain points and perspectives that we may have missed in our current design. Testing our assumptions and verifying the user experience decisions we've made will be a positive next step. 
            To test the physical product, life ratio product models will be 3D printed and sent out to volunteers for testing. Based on the results, the shape and feel of the product are subjected to change. 
            Another next step would be to identify key metrics post-launch, to measure usability and success. This can help us validate or challenge some of the assumptions made during the process.

          <h2 class="pt-5">Key Takeaways</h2>
          <h4 class="pt-5 pb-3" style="color: #3AADAA;">Communication is key</h4>
          <p >I found that with more communication, the relationship between co-workers becomes closer and meetings become more fruitful as people are more open to sharing their ideas. More casual meetings is very helpful!</p>
          <h4 class="pt-5 pb-3" style="color: #3AADAA;">Work with your users</h4>
          <p >During my time working on this project, I worked closely with my boss, who is a pelvic cancer patient undergoing therapy. I found that constantly asking for her feedback was a great way for ensuring I am building a useful solution and to discover problems with my design.</p>
